# Goal Zero Lithium 1400/3000
A rolling base for the Goal Zero Lithium 1400 (and, probably, 3000)
for indoor use.  This model is just some corners supports, you need print
four of these, then use 
- 2x 5cm and 2x 10cm OpenBeam (or MakerBeam) 1515 extrusions
- 4x casters with M10 threaded rods
- 4x M10 washers
- 4x M10 nuts
- 8x M3 x 10 bolts
- 8x M3 x 8 bolts
- 8x M3 x 6 bolts
- 24x M3 nuts
- 8x 3mm x 30mm felt pads (I used two 1.5mm pads back to back)
to complete the build.
