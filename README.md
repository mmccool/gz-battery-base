# Goal Zero Lithium 1400/3000
A rolling base for the Goal Zero Lithium 1400 (or, probably, 3000)
for indoor use.  Actually, this is just some corners, you need print
four of these, then use two
5cm and two 10cm OpenBeam (or MakerBeam) extrusions and four casters
with 8mm threaded rods, four washers, four M8 nuts, and eight M3 x 8 bolts
and eight M3 nuts to complete the build.
